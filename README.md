# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

So far the program takes in a user input, checks if the lenth of it is 1 and that it is in the alphabet, and prints a corresponding message if so, and also if it isn't.

All of this is contained in two separate functions, one to get the input and one to verify the input.

Update: correction of the syntax for the while condition.

Update 12/12/22:
All previous functionality contained inside 'Hangman' class.

## Milestone 5:
Function created that takes in word_list as a parameter. 
It creates an instance of the Hangman class, then using a while loop and if statement, checks firstly if the number of lives left is 0. If it is, it prints a losing statement then breaks out of the while loop, ending the game.
If there are still lives left, an elif statement checks how many letters are left to guess. If there are any letters left, the ask_for_input method is called.
If there are no letters left to guess, the statement ends with an else clause, printing a congratulatory message and breaking out of the while loop.
