# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

So far the program takes in a user input, checks if the lenth of it is 1 and that it is in the alphabet, and prints a corresponding message if so, and also if it isn't.

All of this is contained in two separate functions, one to get the input and one to verify the input.

Update: correction of the syntax for the while condition.
